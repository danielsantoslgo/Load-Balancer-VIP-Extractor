# Load Balancer VIP Extractor

A powerful Python script that does exactly this: it takes raw data from a file and pulls out key information—specifically VIP names and IP addresses from a Load Balancer—and exports it into a CSV file (like a mini spreadsheet).

## Features

- Parses raw data for "vsvip" blocks.
- Extracts VIP names and corresponding IP addresses.
- Outputs the extracted data into a clean CSV file.
- Uses only standard Python modules (`re` and `csv`).
